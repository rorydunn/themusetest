Hello,

Included in this repository are files that are not used in my final solution.
I included them to give a better idea of how I came to my solution and to show
what I was attempting to do as my solution is not ideal.

Files that aren't used or aren't fully functional:
  docker/app.dockerfile
  docker/web.dockerfile
  docker/vhost.conf
  public/index.php
  scripts/ecs_deploy_nat.sh
  scripts/ecs_deploy_privatelink.sh
  docker-compose.yml.txt

I started with using a docker-compose file after reading about this
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/cmd-ecs-cli-compose.html
and thinking that this would be a good way to easily manage and modify a local setup
and deploy it to ECS.  What I found after trying it out is that the docker-compose
build flag can't be used with ECS so I realized I would need to reference a
remote docker image.

Referencing a remote docker image later became an issue when I created a new VPC
with private subnets and used AWS PrivateLink. The containers can connect to the
cluster but the containers can't download remote docker images. This could be
solved by putting the images in ECR but i didn't want the user to have to store
images in their own ECR to run this project.
